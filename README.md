### Overview
This repository contains Ethereum smart contracts for ERC20 token and Vault functionalities. These contracts are designed to facilitate token management and secure storage of tokens.

### Contracts
1. **ERC20 Token Contract**: This contract implements the ERC20 standard, which defines a set of rules for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functions to transfer tokens, approve spending limits for other addresses, and check balances.

2. **Vault Contract**: The Vault contract provides secure storage for tokens by allowing users to deposit and withdraw tokens. It ensures that deposited tokens are safely stored and can only be withdrawn by the owner of the tokens.

### Features
- **ERC20 Token Features**:
  - Transfer tokens between addresses.
  - Approve spending limits for specific addresses.
  - Check token balances.
  - Events for transfer and approval actions.

- **Vault Features**:
  - Deposit tokens securely.
  - Withdraw tokens with proper authorization.
  - Only the owner of deposited tokens can withdraw them.
  - Events for deposit and withdrawal actions.

### Usage
1. **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy both ERC20 token and Vault contracts to the Ethereum blockchain using a compatible Ethereum development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

2. **Interact with ERC20 Token Contract**:
   - Use functions such as `transfer`, `approve`, and `balanceOf` to manage tokens.
   - Emit events like `Transfer` and `Approval` for tracking token movements.

3. **Interact with Vault Contract**:
   - Deposit tokens into the Vault using the `deposit` function.
   - Withdraw tokens using the `withdraw` function, ensuring proper authorization.
   - Monitor `Deposit` and `Withdrawal` events to track activities.

### Security Considerations
- Ensure proper access control mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the Vault.
- Implement tests to verify the functionality and security of the contracts.
- Consider auditing the contracts by security experts to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Dependencies
- These contracts may depend on Ethereum development tools like Truffle or Hardhat for deployment and testing.
- Ensure that the environment is set up with the necessary dependencies before deploying or interacting with the contracts.
